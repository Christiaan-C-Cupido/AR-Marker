# AR-Marker
This learning experience teaches creating AR apps that respond to the user's physical environment. The first app is marker-based, projecting 3D models on specific images. The second app detects flat surfaces, allowing users to create portals. Anchoring AR content to real-world objects enhances immersive experiences.
